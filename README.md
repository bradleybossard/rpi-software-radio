# rpi-software-radio
Dockerfile for Raspberry Pi based software radio

The goal of this project is to implement a Dockerfile that implements the software
radio described in the following tutorial (which I have successfully got working outside of Docker)

[Raspberry Pi Bassed Wireless FM Microphone](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Based-Wireless-Microphone/?ALLSTEPS)

Currently, this does not work, but I think it should be able to as there are Dockerfile like the following

[Let's get physical with Docker](http://blog.hypriot.com/post/lets-get-physical/)

which is able to access the GPIO pins via a Dockerfile.
